Product details:

The Weighted Silk Eye Mask is a sleep-enhancing mask made of fine quality mulberry silk. It is designed to block out light and provide a calming, therapeutic effect to your eyes. The mask is naturally hypoallergenic, breathable, and temperature regulating. It features a long fiber mulberry silk cover that prevents creases and protects the delicate eye area from friction. The mask also has a secure elastic headband covered in silk and contains all-natural glass beads in a baffled internal design for gentle, even pressure. It can be hand washed with mild detergent and laid flat to dry. The mask is available in the color Sand and is priced at $75. 

The Weighted Silk Eye Mask is considered a sleep essential due to its features and benefits. It is made from 100% pure mulberry silk, which is known for its high quality and refined feel. The silk contains natural proteins and amino acids that soothe the delicate eye area. The mask is breathable, moisture-wicking, and insulating, keeping the skin hydrated and preventing moisture loss. It has a smooth yet durable 22 momme silk construction and an extra-smooth charmeuse weave for a luxurious feel and to prevent wrinkles and creases on the skin. 

Using a weighted eye mask can improve sleep by signaling the brain that it's time for bed. The mask blocks out disruptive blue light and ambient light, helping the mind and body wind down for sleep. The gentle deep pressure stimulation from the mask induces feelings of calm, comfort, and relaxation, aiding in falling asleep faster. A dark environment also promotes the production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. Additionally, the weighted eye mask may help soothe tired or dry eyes and ease tension headaches. 

The Weighted Silk Eye Mask is available for purchase on the Saatva website for $75. There is a 45-day free return policy, free shipping, and a 1-year limited warranty.
