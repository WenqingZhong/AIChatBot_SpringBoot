Linen is exceptionally breathable, allowing great airflow and natural moisture-wicking properties to keep you cool in warm weather and warm in colder weather. It is also considered to be the most durable natural fiber, lasting for a long time with proper care. Linen gets better and softer with time, becoming more luxurious with every wash. It helps promote healthier sleep by being hypoallergenic and resistant to dust mites and other allergens. Linen is also healthier for the planet as it requires less water and energy to grow than cotton and is biodegradable.
