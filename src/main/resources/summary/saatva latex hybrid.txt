Product 1 Summary: This mattress is made with GOLS-certified organic natural latex, GOTS certified organic New Zealand wool, and a cover made with organic cotton.

Product 3 Summary: This mattress is made with organic, natural, and nontoxic materials. It has GOLS certified organic natural latex, a cover made with organic cotton and GOTS certified organic wool, and a base made of organic eco loft pad. The mattress has an ergonomic design with enhanced support and durability in the lumbar region. It minimizes motion transfer and maintains great airflow. The base provides stability and prevents shifting of the layers.

In general, all three products are made with organic, natural, and nontoxic materials. They prioritize comfort, support, breathability, and durability. They are also hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens. The mattresses have different features such as zoned support, ventilation channels, and edge support.
The first product is a mattress foundation that is great for making your bed the focal point of your bedroom and giving added height to your mattress. It is compatible with all mattresses, including the Zenhaven Latex Mattress and Saatva HD.

The second product is an adjustable base that is great for helping to relieve back and joint pain, as well as providing the ability to raise the head and feet of the mattress independently. It is compatible with all Saatva mattresses except for the Saatva Classic 14.5" height and Saatva HD.

The third product is a platform bed frame that is great for those who prefer a sleek, low-profile look and do not want to use a foundation or box spring. It is compatible with most mattresses, but when used with the dual-sided Zenhaven Natural Latex Mattress, a solid surface must be added over the slats.

Overall, these products offer different options for bed setup and support, catering to different preferences and needs.
