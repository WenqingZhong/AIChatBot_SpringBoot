Why natural latex?
There’s nothing quite like the buoyant, pressure-free support of natural latex. Our latex goes through a washing process to remove all allergy-causing proteins, so all you’re left with is pure, lasting comfort.
DurabilityExpand/Collapse
Latex is the most durable sleep material on the market, outlasting traditional foams and memory foams.
Excellent pressure reliefExpand/Collapse
Its buoyant, balanced support relieves pressure points for better sleep.
Superb breathabilityExpand/Collapse
Natural latex is more breathable than polyurethane foams or other synthetic comfort foams.
Frequently asked questions
- What sleep positions work best with the Saatva Pillow?Expand/Collapse
All sleep positions will enjoy optimal support for the head and neck with the Saatva Latex Pillow. The responsive shredded latex foam core and down-like fiber fill offer a great balance of plush comfort and optimal support.
It’s also available in two loft heights to accommodate every type of sleeper.
- Are your pillows hypoallergenic?Expand/Collapse
Absolutely. We use hypoallergenic microdenier fiber and hypoallergenic 100% shredded natural latex, all encased in 100% organic cotton.
- Can I wash a latex pillow?Expand/Collapse
Our Saatva Latex Pillow has a washable organic cotton outer cover and microdenier fiber pillow. Simply unzip the cover, remove the core of shredded natural latex, and machine wash the cover and pillow. Please DO NOT wash the shredded latex core. We recommend washing your pillow twice a year and replacing after 3 years or so.
- What sleep positions work best with the Latex Pillow?Expand/Collapse
All sleep positions will enjoy optimal support for the head and neck with the Saatva Latex Pillow. The responsive shredded latex foam core and down-like fiber fill offer a great balance of plush comfort and optimal support.
It’s also available in two loft heights to accommodate every type of sleeper.
- What if I have a latex allergy?Expand/Collapse
The natural latex we use in some of our mattresses, as well as our Saatva Latex Pillow and Latex Mattress Topper,  goes through a thorough washing process to remove all allergy-causing proteins. Additionally, the latex layer never actually comes into contact with the skin, making it safe even for those with latex allergies.
- Are latex pillows safe?Expand/Collapse
Yes. Natural latex pillows are free of harmful chemicals and VOCs (volatile organic compounds), so they won't off-gas (emit an unpleasant chemical odor) in your home. Natural latex is also antimicrobial and resistant to mildew, dust mites, and other indoor allergens.
- Are latex pillows hot?Expand/Collapse
Natural latex is superbly breathable to keep you cooler and more comfortable through the night.
- How long do latex pillows last?Expand/Collapse
We recommend replacing your Saatva Latex Pillow after about 3 years of regular use.
- Is a latex pillow better than a memory foam pillow?Expand/Collapse
It depends on your particular sleep needs. Both latex pillows and memory foam pillows provide excellent head and neck support for different sleep positions.They're also hypoallergenic and inhibit the growth of dust mites and other allergens. If you tend to sleep hot, however, a latex pillow made of 100% natural materials is going to be more breathable than its memory foam counterpart.
- Is your latex pillow adjustable?Expand/Collapse
Saatva Latex Pillows are not adjustable but they do come in two different loft height options to suit all sleep positions and preferences.
- What sizes are your pillows?Expand/Collapse
Saatva pillows are available in Queen and King sizes.
Below are the dimensions of our pillows:
Saatva Latex Pillows Queen 28" x 18"King 34" x 18"
Graphite Memory Foam Pillows, Cloud Memory Foam Pillows & Down Alternative Pillows Queen 28" x 16"King 34" x 16"
Please note that our pillows are slightly larger than standard queen and king sizes. We recommend using our Saatva pillowcases with your Saatva pillow.
- How thick are your pillows?Expand/Collapse
Each Saatva pillow is designed to provide comfortable and optimal head and neck support. When finding the right pillow for you, pillow thickness/height (also known as “loft height”) is an important factor to consider.
These are the loft heights of our Saatva pillows:


- Saatva Latex Pillow - Standard Loft 4-5' or High Loft 6-7"
- Down Alternative Pillow - 7"
- Graphite Memory Foam Pillow - 6.5"
- Cloud Memory Foam Pillow - 6"
And below are our general recommendations for pillow height/thickness for each sleep position:Stomach sleepers: low- loft pillow 3” to 4” thickBack sleepers: medium-loft pillow around 5” thick.Side sleepers: high-loft pillow around 6” to 7”Combination sleepers: medium-loft pillow around 5” thick.
