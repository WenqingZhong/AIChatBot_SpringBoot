Why you'll love our cotton weighted blanket
Staple
Promotes restful sleep
Our weighted blanket has a soothing, calming effect. The feeling is similar to being hugged, a science-backed phenomenon known as “deep pressure stimulation".
Thread
Soft, cozy, and breathable
Natural cotton velvet is soft to the touch for maximum comfort and warmth. Gentle, even pressure from all-natural glass beads encourages relaxation.
Fair Trade
Ethically Sourced
Every step in crafting our cotton has been guided by our commitment to improving the livelihood of the workers who handcraft our bedding in India.
Cotton
Healthier Sleep
The natural cotton fiber we use in our weighted blanket is free of potentially harmful chemicals and we only use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes.
Frequently asked questions
- What is a weighted blanket and what does it do?Expand/Collapse
Weighted blankets (or "weighted comforters") are blankets with some type of weighted fill. Weighted blanket filling is typically made up of glass beads, plastic pellets, or natural grains like rice or buckwheat. Our Weighted Blanket is filled with natural glass beads.
The idea behind weighted blankets comes from something called "deep pressure stimulation" or "deep pressure therapy". It's the same pressure that soothes babies when they're being swaddled or lulls a child to sleep after they're tucked in. A weighted blanket can make you feel more secure, grounded, and calm, like the feeling of a cozy hug, helping to promote more restful sleep.
- Are weighted blankets safe for kids and toddlers?Expand/Collapse
We’ve designed our weighted blanket for adults of all body sizes and types. Our weighted blanket is not recommended for children. As a general guideline, a weighted blanket should be about 10% to 15% of your body weight.
- What size weighted blanket do I need?Expand/Collapse
When it comes to finding the right weighted blanket for you, look at the weight of the blanket. As a general guideline, you want a weighted blanket that's about 10% to 15% of your body weight. For example, if you weigh 120 pounds, you would look for a 12-pound weighted blanket or something close.
- How heavy should a weighted blanket be?Expand/Collapse
As a general guideline, you want a weighted blanket that's about 10% to 15% of your body weight. For example, if you weigh 120 pounds, you would look for a 12-pound weighted blanket or something close.
- Are weighted blankets hot?Expand/Collapse
For some people, particularly those who tend to sleep hot, a weighted blanket might feel too hot above certain room temperatures. If you tend to get hot under heavy blankets, reserve your weighted blanket for extra cold nights when you want to an extra dose of cozy, calming comfort.
- Do weighted blankets keep you warm?Expand/Collapse
Yes! Because of their added weight, weighted blankets are an excellent choice for staying warm on cold nights. Our weighted blanket is covered in 100% breathable cotton velvet, so it's soft to the touch for maximum comfort.
- Do you put weighted blankets over comforters?Expand/Collapse
Our 20 lb weighted blanket is meant to be used on queen or king sized beds and can be used as a substitute for a regular comforter. For extra warmth and weight, you can layer your weighted blanket over your favorite comforter.
- Is it ok to sleep with a weighted blanket every night?Expand/Collapse
Yes. You can use your weighted blanket every night or you can just use it on nights when you're a little too wound up and need an extra layer of cozy, calming comfort.
- What is Fair Trade Certified™ cotton?Expand/Collapse

- Will you offer more colors in the future?Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
