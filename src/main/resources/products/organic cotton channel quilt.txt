What makes our organic cotton quilt so special?
Silky-soft yet durable
Long organic cotton fibers are woven into a sateen weave to give you its distinctive subtle luster and beautiful drape.
Just the right thread count
As thread counts rise, fabrics become warmer. We chose a thread count of 300 for the perfect balance of softness and breathability.
Channel quilt pattern
The refined 1” channel stitch pattern lends a relaxed, cozy feel to the quilt and shams that never goes out of style.
Organic all the way
We only use GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified organic long-staple cotton. It's naturally breathable and hypoallergenic, so it's not only better for the planet, it's better for you.
Three ways to enjoy your cotton quilt
Use it on its own on warmer nightsExpand/Collapse
When you just need a lightweight layer over your sheets, use the cotton quilt instead of your duvet. You can even use it in lieu of a top sheet.
Either option is perfect for warm summer nights when breathability is key.
Layer it with your duvet on chilly nightsExpand/Collapse
If your feet tend to get cold, you can fold the quilt over your duvet at the foot of your bed for an extra layer of warmth.
You can also place it under your duvet, hotel style. That way, you have the option of keeping your duvet folded over your legs or layer both over you on extra chilly nights.
Cozy up on the couchExpand/Collapse
Our cotton quilt isn’t just for bed. Because it’s so lightweight, you can easily take it to the couch as a blanket for movie nights or binge watching your favorite shows.

Frequently asked questions
- What is a quilt?Expand/Collapse
A traditional quilt is made of a three layer construction: a top side textile (typically cotton or linen), a thin middle layer of batting (typically some type of poly, wool, or cotton fill) that determines the warmth of the quilt, and a bottom side textile that is soft to the touch but also more durable. As the name suggests, these three layers are quilted together, usually with a quilt pattern like diamond, channel, pick-stitch, etc.
- What’s the difference between a quilt and a comforter?Expand/Collapse
Quilts are lighter, thinner, and less lofty than typical comforters or duvet inserts. Quilts are a great option for the warmer months or to add a layer of warmth on top of your comforter. Comforters are warmer and more insulated than quilts on their own because they have more fill material. Quilts sit more flush to your bed than a fluffy, lofty comforter or duvet insert.
- What is the difference between a blanket and quilt?Expand/Collapse
The main difference is in their construction. A blanket is a single layer that’s either woven, crocheted, or knitted. Blankets vary in thickness and can be used alone or as a layer on top of a top sheet or with a comforter for added warmth.
A quilt is constructed with three layers. It has an outer shell consisting of a top and bottom layer, plus a batting or fill made of either wool, down, cotton, polyester, rayon or a combination of those materials. Quilts also serve the same purpose of keeping you warm. It can be used alone or layered with other bedding.
- What is the best way to clean my quilt?Expand/Collapse
We recommend spot cleaning as needed. You can also machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best.
- What's the difference between your sateen and percale cotton?Expand/Collapse
Percale sheets have a crisp feel with a luxe matte finish while sateen sheets have a silky-soft feel with a subtle luster.
- What is a sateen weave and why is it preferable?Expand/Collapse
Sateen cotton is woven with long-staple organic cotton yarn using a one-yarn-over, three-yarn-under weave structure. This technique creates a silky-soft feel known for its luster and drape.
- What does thread count mean, and why does it matter?Expand/Collapse
Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes.
Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count.
We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric.
For more about thread count, check out our blog..
- What is GOTS?Expand/Collapse
The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria.
- What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?Expand/Collapse
Bedding and bath products returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash any used products before returning.
To make a bedding or bath return, simply call 1-877-672-2882 or email info@saatvamattress.com. If you received our bedding as a gift, please call us for help with your return.
- What is the exchange policy for bedding?Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
- Will you offer more colors in the future?Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bedding.
- Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more?Expand/Collapse
