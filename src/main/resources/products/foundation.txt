Frequently asked questions
- What is a mattress foundation?Expand/Collapse
A foundation can be covered in fabric or have an exposed wood frame, with a solid top or one made of wood slats.The main purpose of a mattress foundation is to raise your sleeping surface to a comfortable height and give your mattress optimal support.
- What's the difference between a mattress foundation and a box spring?Expand/Collapse
In the past, box springs used to be made of wood and filled with metal coils to add a springy flexibility and cushioning to the thin, stiff mattresses of those days. Nowadays, what some people still call "box springs" are more accurately called mattress foundations or bed foundations. They don't contain metal springs anymore, but serve the same purpose of making your bed setup more comfortable and supportive.
- Do I need a mattress foundation if I have a platform bed?Expand/Collapse
No. A platform bed with a solid or slatted surface doesn't require the addition of a mattress foundation. Always check your mattress specifications to make sure your bed setup works with your new mattress.
- What is the Saatva foundation warranty?Expand/Collapse
Our mattress foundation comes with a lifetime warranty. View the mattress foundation warranty page for details.
- What height foundation should I choose?Expand/Collapse
Saatva offers two foundation heights, 4.75" and 8.75." There is no difference in quality or performance between the two heights; the choice is a matter of personal preference and the overall height of the bed setup you want. One consideration is whether you plan to use your existing bed skirt. The "drop" on a standard bed skirt is 14" to 15," which works with the 8.75" foundation and a standard 7" bed frame.
- Do I need a foundation for my mattress?Expand/Collapse
Deciding whether you need a Saatva foundation or box spring for your new mattress depends on the kind of bed you plan on using (platform beds, for example, don't need a foundation), your existing mattress foundation or box spring, and whether or not you plan to use an adjustable base.

You will need the Saatva box foundation if:
- Your existing foundation or support system is more than 7 years old.
- Your existing support creaks, has soft spots, or is damaged in any way.
- You want a foundation designed to support your specific mattress. Our Saatva HD, for example, requires pairing with our HD foundation for optimal support.
- You want a foundation that matches your mattress. We use the same organic cotton blend cover for the Saatva box foundation as we do for our mattresses.

You won't need the Saatva box foundation if:
- You purchased a mattress support system within the last 7 years.
- Your existing foundation is in good condition and provides sturdy center support.
- You don't mind not having matching foundation.
- You have a platform bed, which does not require a foundation.
- You have an adjustable base, which takes the place of a foundation or box spring.
To learn more about choosing the right support system for your mattress, see our article on mattress foundations.
- Does Saatva offer a split queen foundation?Expand/Collapse
Yes, you can order a split queen foundation to make delivery easier if you have an especially narrow staircase or hallway in your home. There is no difference in comfort or quality between a split queen foundation and regular foundation. Note: A split foundation is standard on king and California king sizes.
- Can I put plywood under my mattress?Expand/Collapse
Some people use what's called a bunkie board under their mattress to give it additional support. This a thin piece of material, often plywood or particleboard, that can be used with any type of bed setup, whether it's an old box spring, foundation, or a slatted platform bed frame. You don't need to add a plywood support on our Saatva mattress foundation as it already provides the optimal support your mattress needs.
- Is the Universal Frame compatible with separate headboard attachments?Expand/Collapse
Yes. Our steel Universal Frame has a plate at the top for headboard attachments. Please check with the manufacturer of your headboard to make sure it's compatible with standard metal frames.+
