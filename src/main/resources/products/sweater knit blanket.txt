Frequently asked questions
- What is the difference between a blanket and quilt?Expand/Collapse
The main difference is in their construction. A blanket is a single layer that’s either woven, crocheted, or knitted. Blankets vary in thickness and can be used alone or as a layer on top of a top sheet or with a comforter for added warmth.
A quilt is constructed with three layers. It has an outer shell consisting of a top and bottom layer, plus a batting or fill made of either wool, down, cotton, polyester, rayon or a combination of those materials. Quilts also serve the same purpose of keeping you warm. It can be used alone or layered with other bedding.
- Are knit blankets warm?Expand/Collapse
Knit blankets can vary in warmth depending on the materials used and its thickness. We use 100% cotton for our knit blanket for a balance of softness, breathability, and warmth.
- What is GSM?Expand/Collapse
GSM stands for “grams per meter” and refers to the weight of a fabric. In general, the higher the fabric’s GSM, the thicker and warmer it feels.
Below are the GSM weights of some of our bedding:
• Lightweight Down Alternative Comforter: lightweight 220 GSM
• All-Year Down Alternative Comforter: medium-weight 340 GSM
• Heavyweight Down Alternative Comforter: heavyweight 420 GSM
• Waffle Knit Blanket: medium-weight 320 GSM
• Sweater Knit Blanket: heavyweight 460 GSM
- What is OEKO-TEX®?Expand/Collapse
The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals.
- What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?Expand/Collapse
Bedding and bath products returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash any used products before returning.
To make a bedding or bath return, simply call 1-877-672-2882 or email info@saatvamattress.com. If you received our bedding as a gift, please call us for help with your return.
- What is the exchange policy for bedding?Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
- Will you offer more colors in the future?Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
- Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more?Expand/Collapse
We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students.
