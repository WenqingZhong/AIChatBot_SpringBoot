Frequently asked questions
- How do I wash my Down Alternative Pillow?Expand/Collapse
Spot clean as needed.
- Is your Down Alternative Pillow hypoallergenic?Expand/Collapse
Absolutely. We use two types of hypoallergenic down alternative fibers, microdenier down alternative and supportive memory fibers, wrapped in 100% organic cotton.
- What sleep positions work best with the Down Alternative Pillow?Expand/Collapse
Our Down Alternative Pillow is highly moldable, meaning it suits most sleep styles. It’s a particularly good pick for people who like to cuddle with their pillow at night.
- How does the Down Alternative Pillow keep me cool?Expand/Collapse
This Down Alternative Pillow absorbs very little body heat while offering a high volume of airflow which allows you to sleep very cool.
- What are down alternative pillows made of?Expand/Collapse
Rather than using goose feathers and down as fill, down alternative pillows use hypoallergenic synthetic fibers that mimic the plush, lofty feel of traditional down pillows.
- How long do down alternative pillows last?Expand/Collapse
The National Sleep Foundation recommends replacing your pillows every two years or so. A handy test you can do to see if it's time to replace your old down alternative pillow is to fold it in half lengthwise and hold it for 30 seconds. If it doesn't go back to its original shape when you let go, it might be time for a new pillow.
- Are down alternative pillows safe?Expand/Collapse
Most down alternative pillows are more hypoallergenic than traditional down pillows. We go a step further by covering ours with a hypoallergenic organic cotton shell to make sure it's free of harmful chemicals.
- Are down alternative pillows good for neck pain?Expand/Collapse
As long as your down alternative pillow is plush, it should give you enough support for your head and neck. Our down alternative pillow has an added fill of supportive memory fiber clusters to offer greater support while maintaining a fluffy, airy feel.
If you suffer from chronic neck pain, you might do better with a firmer, more supportive pillow that contours to your head and neck as you move like a memory foam or latex pillow.
- What sizes are your pillows?Expand/Collapse
Saatva pillows are available in Queen and King sizes.
Below are the dimensions of our pillows:
Saatva Latex Pillows Queen 28" x 18"King 34" x 18"
Graphite Memory Foam Pillows, Cloud Memory Foam Pillows & Down Alternative Pillows Queen 28" x 16"King 34" x 16"
Please note that our pillows are slightly larger than standard queen and king sizes. We recommend using our Saatva pillowcases with your Saatva pillow.
- How thick are your pillows?Expand/Collapse
Each Saatva pillow is designed to provide comfortable and optimal head and neck support. When finding the right pillow for you, pillow thickness/height (also known as “loft height”) is an important factor to consider.
These are the loft heights of our Saatva pillows:


- Saatva Latex Pillow - Standard Loft 4-5' or High Loft 6-7"
- Down Alternative Pillow - 7"
- Graphite Memory Foam Pillow - 6.5"
- Cloud Memory Foam Pillow - 6"
And below are our general recommendations for pillow height/thickness for each sleep position:Stomach sleepers: low- loft pillow 3” to 4” thickBack sleepers: medium-loft pillow around 5” thick.Side sleepers: high-loft pillow around 6” to 7”Combination sleepers: medium-loft pillow around 5” thick.
- What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?Expand/Collapse
Bedding and bath products returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash any used products before returning.
To make a bedding or bath return, simply call 1-877-672-2882 or email info@saatvamattress.com. If you received our bedding as a gift, please call us for help with your return.
- What is the exchange policy for bedding?Expand/Collapse
