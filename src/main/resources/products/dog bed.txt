Micro coils, big comfort
To build a dog bed like no other, we started at the core.
Our durable micro-coil support core helps keep your pet’s back happy, keeps them cooler, and makes moving around in bed much easier.
*For dogs that are heavy chewers, keep an eye on the bed cover’s condition to ensure they don’t chew down to internal parts and to prevent damage to the bed's core.
Cozy, cuddly & easy to clean
Your pet’s bed can look ruff after a while. We made our ultra-luxe, high-performance fabric cover resistant to spills and stains, so cleanup is a breeze.
Need a backup? We have replacement bed covers available.
The comfort your pet deserves, built into every layer

Frequently asked questions
- Do dogs need dog beds?Expand/Collapse
Although most dogs can snooze just about anywhere, it’s much better for the long term health of their joints & muscles to sleep on a supportive bed designed just for them.
The Saatva Dog Bed has a micro-coil unit at its core, making it very different from other dog beds on the market. This coil unit contours better to your pet’s body so it cradles them in great support. It also makes the bed more responsive, which makes getting in and out of bed easier, particularly for older pups.
- What should I look for in a dog bed?Expand/Collapse
A dog bed with a durable, high-quality cover that’s removable and machine washable is a great place to start. This makes the inevitable clean ups a breeze.
Second, look for adequate support like the quilted comfort fibers and micro-coils inside the Saatva Dog Bed. A pet bed with inadequate or low-quality filling can fall flat, leaving a less than desirable sleep surface for your furry friend.
- How often should I replace a dog bed?Expand/Collapse
Most regular dog beds filled with memory foam or fiber should be replaced after a year or less, especially if your dog is a chewer. Our Saatva Dog Bed is designed to hold its shape and support longer than regular dog beds without mico-coils.
We suggest replacing your Saatva Dog Bed after a year and half to two years or when you notice holes and other damage to the bed. If you notice your pet stops using their dog bed, that’s also a good sign that it’s time for a replacement.
- Can I purchase extra covers for the Saatva Dog Bed?Expand/Collapse
Yes! We sell extra removable bed covers.
- Can my cat use the Saatva Dog Bed?Expand/Collapse
Absolutely! Our small pet bed size accommodates small dogs and average-sized cats.
In fact, almost any furry friend will appreciate a pet bed upgrade from Saatva: pet bunny, pot bellied pig, guinea pigs…we don’t discriminate. Just don’t put your pet llama or any other pet that weighs over 120 pounds on our pet beds!
- Can I leave the Saatva Dog Bed outside?Expand/Collapse
Our dog bed is designed for indoor use only.
- Is the Saatva Dog Bed safe for puppies or heavy chewers?Expand/Collapse
While our durable, high-performance fabric cover is 100% safe for pets, even the strongest fabrics can break down in time. We recommend keeping a close eye on more destructive, heavy-chewing pups to ensure they don’t chew down to the bottom coil unit of the bed to avoid any damage to the internal coils.
If you notice extensive damage that exposes the internal materials of any pet bed, dispose and replace promptly to prevent your pet from swallowing any damaged internal parts.
- What is your return policy for the dog bed?Expand/Collapse
Dog beds returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash your dog bed cover before returning.
To make a return, simply call 1-855-401-5282 or email info@saatva.com. If you received our dog bed as a gift, please call us for help with your return.
- What is the exchange policy for the dog bed?Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva Dog Bed. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
- How do I clean my Saatva Dog Bed?Expand/Collapse
To clean, simply wipe spills promptly with a paper towel or cloth rag. For tougher stains & spills, remove the outer cover, dampen a cloth rag with a mixture of 16 oz. water & 1 Tbsp liquid detergent. Gently blot the soiled area, avoid rubbing. Wipe down the area with a clean damp cloth until all soapy water residue is removed.+
