What makes our organic sheets so special?
Staple
Silky-soft yet durable
Long organic cotton fibers, or staples, are woven into silky-soft yet durable sheets that just get softer and more comfortable with every wash.
Thread
Just the right thread count
As thread counts rise, fabrics become warmer. We chose a thread count of 300 for the perfect balance of softness and breathability.
Fair Trade
Made with Fair Trade Cotton
This bedding product is made with Fair Trade Certified™ cotton that’s sourced with the most rigorous standards of economic and social responsibility for the farmers. We believe it's the most effective way for us to do the most good every day.
Cotton
Organic all the way
We only use GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard)  certified organic cotton. From harvesting to each step of manufacturing, our cotton sheets are organic through and through.
Transparency matters
We pride ourselves on a supply chain that's traceable from end to end. You can rest easy knowing your organic bed sheets are always pure and free of harmful chemicals.
Fair trade fabric
Our Fair Trade Certified™ organic cotton meets the most rigorous social, environmental, and economic standards.
Frequently asked questions
- What is a sateen weave and why is it preferable?Expand/Collapse
Sateen cotton is woven with long-staple cotton yarn using a one-yarn-over, three-yarn-under weave structure. This technique creates a silky-soft feel known for its luster and drape.
- Are sateen sheets cool?Expand/Collapse
Our 300 thread count sateen sheets were designed to balance softness and breathability.
- Are cotton sheets cooler than polyester sheets?Expand/Collapse
Absolutely! Natural fibers are typically more breathable than synthetic fibers like polyester.
The 100% natural long staple cotton we use for our sheets are 200 thread count for the percale and 300 thread count for the sateen, making it the perfect balance of soft and breathable.
- Are 300 thread count sheets good?Expand/Collapse
According to the National Sleep Foundation, the sweet spot for thread count in cotton sheets is between 200 and 400. If you tend to sleep hot, a higher thread count may not be a great choice as it tends to trap body heat. Sticking to that sweet spot for thread count is a good way to ensure your cotton sheets won't feel too warm.
- What's the difference between microfiber sheets and natural cotton sheets?Expand/Collapse
Microfiber sheets are made out of polyester fabric, giving them a soft, stretchy feel. They're more affordable than natural cotton sheets but the drawback is that they're not as breathable as cotton or other natural fibers. They're also not as environmentally friendly to produce because they're made from synthetic fibers.
- What's the difference between percale and sateen cotton?Expand/Collapse
Percale cotton has a crisp feel with a luxe matte finish while sateen cotton has a silky-soft feel with a subtle luster.
- What are organic sheets?Expand/Collapse
Organic bed sheets are made from fibers grown without chemical insecticides or synthetic fertilizers. They're also either undyed or use environmentally-friendly dyes. Sleeping on organic sheets lessens your daily exposure to potentially harmful or skin-irritating chemicals that might be present in non-organic sheets.
- What does thread count mean, and why does it matter?Expand/Collapse
Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes.
Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count.
We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric.
For more about thread count, check out our blog..
- What is the best way to wash my sheets?Expand/Collapse
We’re glad you asked! Machine wash your bedding in cold water, with like colors, on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly—we’ve made our bedding slightly larger to account for natural shrinkage after first wash. Mild, organic detergents work best.
- What is GOTS?Expand/Collapse
The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria.
- What is Fair Trade Certified™ cotton?Expand/Collapse
Products made with Fair Trade Certified™ cotton are made according to rigorous social, environmental, and economic Fair Trade Standards. This means the farmers and workers behind that product earn additional money from your purchase to empower and uplift their communities.
All businesses that work with Fair Trade are held to these rigorous standards, which drive income sustainability, community and individual well-being, empowerment, and environmental stewardship. They include requirements around worker’s rights, fair labor practices, and responsible land management. These standards ensure that goods are made with care for the people and planet.
- What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?Expand/Collapse
Bedding and bath products returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash any used products before returning.
To make a bedding or bath return, simply call 1-877-672-2882 or email info@saatvamattress.com. If you received our bedding as a gift, please call us for help with your return.
- What is the exchange policy for bedding?Expand/Collapse
At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice.
- Will you offer more colors in the future?Expand/Collapse
Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
- Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more?Expand/Collapse
We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students. To apply the discount, simply click on the "Discount for first responders & more" box at checkout. You will be prompted to register with ID.me to verify your status and receive the discount.

Frequently asked questions
- What is a duvet cover?Expand/Collapse
A duvet cover is a protective and decorative fabric layer that goes over a duvet (also called a “duvet insert”) and has some type of closure like buttons or zipper.
It's a great way to keep your duvet/duvet insert clean. You can also easily change up the look of your bed by switching out your duvet cover.
- What is the best way to clean my duvet cover?Expand/Collapse
Machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best.
- What's the difference between percale and sateen cotton?Expand/Collapse
Percale cotton has a crisp feel with a luxe matte finish while sateen cotton has a silky-soft feel with a subtle luster.
- What is a sateen weave and why is it preferable?Expand/Collapse
Sateen cotton is woven with long-staple cotton yarn using a one-yarn-over, three-yarn-under weave structure. This technique creates a silky-soft feel known for its luster and drape.
- What does a duvet set include?Expand/Collapse
A duvet set comes with a duvet cover and pillowcase/s or shams. Our Saatva duvet sets come with matching shams which are designed to be more decorative and placed over your duvet cover.
Depending on the size, a duvet cover set comes with one standard/queen pillowcase or sham for twin-twin XL, or two standard/queen or king size pillowcases or shams for queen and king/Cal king.
- What is the difference between a duvet and a comforter?Expand/Collapse
The terms “comforter” and “duvet” (also known as “duvet insert”) are sometimes used interchangeably. Traditionally, a comforter is meant to be used on its own and doesn’t require a cover. It can either have a decorative print or a solid color.
In contrast, a duvet (AKA duvet insert) is designed to be used inside a duvet cover which you can wash and switch out regularly. Duvets are also typically fluffier than traditional comforters and quilts because they are filled with down alternative or some other lightweight fill.
Our Saatva All-Year Comforter is actually a hybrid of both. Like a comforter, it can be used on its own without a duvet because it’s super soft and machine washable. Unlike a traditional comforter, it has the cloud-like softness and lightweight breathability of a duvet.
We recommend using the All-Year Comforter as a duvet insert inside our duvet covers to give you more versatility and ease when laundry day comes around.
- What is a pillow sham?Expand/Collapse
A sham goes over a pillow and its main purpose is decorative. It typically has some sort of border to enhance the look of your pillow. Shams are meant for pillows that sit on top of a made bed. Shams and duvet covers are a quick, easy way to change up the look of your bed setup with the seasons.
Unlike regular pillowcases, which have an opening on one end,most pillow shams have an envelope flap in the middle or hidden zippers to conceal the opening for a more finished “top-of-bed” look.
- Are 300 thread count sheets good?Expand/Collapse
According to the National Sleep Foundation, the sweet spot for thread count in cotton sheets is between 200 and 400. If you tend to sleep hot, a higher thread count may not be a great choice as it tends to trap body heat. Sticking to that sweet spot for thread count is a good way to ensure your cotton sheets won't feel too warm.
- What does thread count mean, and why does it matter?Expand/Collapse
Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes.
Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count.
We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric.
