The banded percale duvet set is a bedding product that includes a duvet cover and matching shams. It is made from breathable long-staple cotton with a crisp and clean percale weave. The duvet set has a thread count of 200, which provides a balance of softness and breathability. The cotton used is OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 certified, ensuring that it is free of harmful chemicals and is naturally antimicrobial and hypoallergenic. The duvet cover and shams feature a hand-finished 1" contrasting band for a refined and elegant look. The duvet cover has a hidden zipper closure and the shams have a center envelope opening. Corner ties are included to keep the comforter or duvet insert in place. The duvet set is machine washable and gets softer with each wash. It is available in various sizes and colors. The price for the set is $245.
- Duvet Cover: A protective and decorative fabric layer that goes over a duvet. It helps keep the duvet clean and allows for easy changes in the bed's appearance. It is recommended to machine wash with mild, organic detergents.
- Percale and Sateen Cotton: Percale has a crisp feel with a matte finish, while sateen has a soft feel with a subtle luster. Both are made with long organic cotton fibers.
- Duvet Set: Includes a duvet cover and pillowcase/s or shams. The duvet sets come with matching shams, which are more decorative and placed over the duvet cover.
- Duvet vs. Comforter: A comforter is meant to be used on its own, while a duvet is used inside a duvet cover. Duvets are typically fluffier and filled with lightweight materials. The Saatva All-Year Comforter can be used both ways.
- Pillow Sham: A decorative cover that goes over a pillow. It enhances the look of the pillow and is meant for pillows that sit on top of a made bed.
- Thread Count: The number of threads in one square inch of fabric. Higher thread count can make the fabric warmer, but it's not the only indicator of quality. Saatva uses different thread counts for different fabrics to achieve the right balance of breathability, softness, and durability.
- OEKO-TEX®: Standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings to be free of toxic chemicals.
