Product 1: Duvet Cover 

A duvet cover is a fabric layer that goes over a duvet insert and provides both protection and decoration. It can be easily removed and changed, allowing for a variety of bed looks. To clean a duvet cover, it is best to machine wash it on a gentle cycle with cold water using mild detergents. 

Product 2: Percale Cotton 

Percale cotton provides a crisp feel and has a luxurious matte finish. It is a type of fabric commonly used for duvet covers. 

Product 3: Sateen Cotton 

Sateen cotton offers a silky-soft feel with a subtle luster. It is woven using a one-yarn-over, three-yarn-under technique with long-staple cotton yarn. This creates a fabric known for its draping qualities and softness. Sateen cotton is preferred by many for its luxurious feel.
- A duvet set includes a duvet cover and pillowcase/s or shams. Our Saatva duvet sets come with matching shams that are designed to be more decorative and placed over the duvet cover. The number and size of the pillowcases or shams depend on the size of the duvet cover set.
- The difference between a duvet and a comforter is that a comforter is meant to be used on its own and doesn't require a cover, while a duvet is designed to be used inside a duvet cover which can be washed and switched out regularly. Duvets are typically fluffier than comforters and filled with down alternative or other lightweight fill. Our Saatva All-Year Comforter is a hybrid of both, it can be used on its own without a duvet, but also has the softness and breathability of a duvet. It is recommended to use it as a duvet insert inside our duvet covers for versatility and ease of laundry.
- A pillow sham is a decorative cover that goes over a pillow. It typically has a border to enhance the look of the pillow. Shams are meant for pillows that sit on top of a made bed and can be easily changed to change the look of the bed setup with the seasons.
Product 1: Pillow Shams
Unlike regular pillowcases, most pillow shams have an envelope flap or hidden zippers to conceal the opening for a more finished look on top of the bed.

Product 2: 300 Thread Count Sheets
300 thread count sheets are considered good quality according to the National Sleep Foundation. They provide a balance of breathability, softness, and durability. They are suitable for those who do not sleep hot as higher thread count sheets tend to trap body heat.

Product 3: Thread Count and its Importance
Thread count refers to the number of horizontal and vertical threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. A higher thread count indicates a warmer fabric. However, thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets and it is not the only indicator of quality. Some manufacturers may compromise thread quality to achieve higher thread counts.

Product 4: GOTS
GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) is the leading standard for organic fibers in textile processing. Fabrics with the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria.
Fair Trade Certified™ factories are factories that adhere to rigorous social, environmental, and economic Fair Trade Standards. Products made in these factories provide additional income to farmers and workers, empowering and uplifting their communities. The standards include worker's rights, fair labor practices, and responsible land management, ensuring goods are made with care for people and the planet.

For bedding and bath products, they can be returned within 45 days of delivery for a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but it is requested that used products are washed before returning. To initiate a return, customers can call or email the company.

Currently, there is no exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If customers would like to exchange their merchandise, they will need to return their order and repurchase the desired item.

The current bedding color options are designed to fit a more neutral color palette, complementing any room style with timeless simplicity. The company prioritizes an eco-friendly ethos by using natural, undyed fabric or nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for their bedding.
